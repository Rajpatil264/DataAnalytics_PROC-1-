## Introduction
This script analyzes deforestation data from different time periods using the Pandas library. It generates bar plots to visualize deforestation trends in various regions.

## Importing Libraries
The script starts by importing the required libraries: `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib.pyplot` for data visualization.

## Common Plot Settings
A function named `set_common_plot_settings` is defined to apply common settings to the plots, such as the title and y-axis label.

## Deforestation Plotting
A function named `plot_deforestation` is defined to generate bar plots based on the provided data. It allows visualization of deforestation trends for specific time periods.

## Main Function
The `main` function reads the deforestation data from an Excel file, displays the first and last five rows of the dataset, and generates multiple plots using the `plot_deforestation` function.

## Conclusion
This script provides a structured approach to analyzing and visualizing deforestation data, offering insights into deforestation trends across different regions and time periods.
